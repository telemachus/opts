# TODO: opts

## Parsing

+ Bool is false by default; if passed, it becomes true.  Bools do not accept
  arguments.
+ Arguments with values must use `=`.  Thus, they do not interact with further
  args at all.

## Types

+ Simplify assignment functions available for all types.  There should only be
  one per type.
+ Remove Duration?
